# HW00_Vell_Jey.R
# In this function we take a range of speeds within a given limits of min and max
# values to find the flux for that speed. The flux calcuation consist of
# detemining the total distance a car requires
# Car Default Length
# Default Time to respond  (human brain) => 4 seconds
# Time required for car to respond  = proposational to kinetic speed car holds
# The Time to Stop is maximum value between "Default time to respond" and "Time
# required for car to respond" as they could happen in parallel.
# Finally the calculation is:
# The safety distance between two cars => timeToStop * 1/60 min * 1/60 hours * Car Velocity miles/hour
